## Introduction
You are asked to finish a prototype of a game where you shoot a ball against a goal-keeper, which
is an octopus.


## Exercise 1
Implement the basic mechanics of shooting the ball and the octopus picking it.

## Exercise 2
We will implement the Magnus effect.

## Exercise 3
In this exercise we will upgrade the animations of our scorpion, making him more reactive to its
enviroment by placing it's legs on the scene floor by using a raycast. 

## Exercise 4
In this exercise you have to take the animations provided and use motion builder transfer them to
the Robot character. The task is to have at least 2 robot characters that react to the ball entering
or not the goal (see the optoins of happy or sad animations provided).
